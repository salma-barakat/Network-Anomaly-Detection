# Network-Anomaly-Detection
We will use the ”KDD Cup 1999” dataset, which is a widely
used benchmark dataset for network anomaly detection. This dataset contains
network traffic data collected from a simulated environment, including features
such as protocol type, service, source and destination IP addresses, source and
destination ports, and attack types.</br>
We will use K-Means, Normalized Cut and DB-SCAN then evaluate the models based on their ability to detect network anomalies
accurately.
